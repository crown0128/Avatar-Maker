## Development

In order to run it locally you'll need to fetch some dependencies and a basic server setup.

* Install local dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

* To test your react-avatar and your changes, start the development server and open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

    ```sh
    $ npm run dev
    ```
    
* To create a local production build into the `lib` and `es` folders.

   ```sh
   $ npm run build
   ```
